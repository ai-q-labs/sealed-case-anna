  briefing: `A private bar on the second floor of a second-hand bookshop in Jimbocho.
Four people were in the building tonight. At 02:40 the owner found Rentaro Kadokura —
sixty-one, chief editor at Akeboshi Publishing — dead at the counter, a half-finished
glass in front of him.

The door to the Lantern Room was bolted from the inside. The bolt is a solid iron bar
that drops into a bracket; it cannot be worked from the corridor. The only window is
painted shut and has been for years. There is no other way in.

The police will arrive at 06:00. Until then, the three people still in the building
have agreed to answer your questions.`,

    culprit: "kuroda",

    epilogue: `The room was never sealed against anyone. Kadokura bolted the door himself, the way he did
six times a year when he wanted an hour alone with a piece he was thinking about. The bolt,
the flush door, the painted window — all of it is true, and none of it matters, because the
killer did not need to be in the room. He needed to be at the shelf, and he had been at that
shelf for thirty years.

The aconite went into the keep bottle. That is the new cork: Kuroda drew it, dosed it,
and pushed a fresh one home, and then he left the bottle for a man who poured his own drinks.
Whether Kadokura died at one o'clock or at four was never Kuroda's to decide, and he did not
care. There was only one glass on the counter because there was only ever going to be one.

The woman in the photograph was not a cousin. She was Kuroda's older sister — the librarian
of the 1996 article, who produced documents about a wartime requisition that Kadokura reported
did not exist. They did exist; they were in a prefectural annex that burned in 1998, and by
then she had been dead for two years.

Kuroda did not open the Lantern Room to forgive him. He framed the article in the stairwell
and put his sister on the shelf behind the counter, and for thirty years he poured a man his
drink under both of them, waiting to see whether he would ever once look up.`,
    near_miss: {
      culprit: `You have the right shape of the crime but the wrong hand behind it.`,
      method: `You have the right person. But ask yourself what the bolt actually proves — and who it
was keeping out.`,
